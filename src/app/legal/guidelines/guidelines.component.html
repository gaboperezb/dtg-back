    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>

    <p>As passionate sports fans, it is important to express your opinions about any topic; this is the main reason why we created this platform. But sometimes, sports discussions may get heated and can reach a point where we offend with our way of communicating. To avoid reaching these levels, it is important to be polite and respectful towards others. For those who canâ€™t behave we have created some rules. In the case that these rules are broken, our moderation team will take appropriate measures with users who do not comply.
